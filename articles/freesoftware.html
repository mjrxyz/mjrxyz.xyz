            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The "free" in "free software" stands for free as in freedom not free as in free beer. Now thats a lot of frees. Thats the thing about free software it's free as in freedom and usually free as in price as well, although free software is usually free. Anyway, into the point of this article, which is why you should use free software despite the inconvenience.   </p>
           <h2>Free software</h2>
           <p>So ... why should you use free software, when it is really inconvenient to? Well, not only does free software allow you to hide from big tech and the alphabet boys but it means that you have total control over the hardware that you bought with your own money! I find that lots of people don't realise just how limited lots of the hardware they may buy is, for example electric car manufacturer Tesla has locked features like self-driving or heated seats behind a paywall but, if you don't buy these features, they are still in your car, which you bought, but not enabled, locked behind proprietary software, what a scam, anyways people made scripts to unlock the features for free and whenever Tesla patches it new ones are made. God I love the internet. What is even crazier is that most people are not ignorant, they actually know they are being spied on and are perfectly contempt and tell you stuff like "I've not nothing to hide", well, neither have I but would you invite a random dude into your home to watch your every move? Since you "have nothing to hide" why not? These same people would be angry at the invasion of privacy of an authoritarian country's secret police, but happily subject themselves to the same invasion of privacy willingly for the latest tech gimmick, it is totally idiotic. If I buy hardware I should own 100% of that hardware and I should be able to use as much or as little of it as I want, if I - God forbid - purchase a Windows lisence I should not be forced to run their proprietary spyware and telementry processes, fuck you I am not your free market reasearch test subject.  </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Conclusion, use free software to kick the creepy guy out of your house and out of your personal business. Have a good day. </p>
